# Memory game

## Usage
This is a simple terminal verion of the classic n-back game.

The game shows random numbers (optional: letters and symbols) and the player have to remember if the current number is equal to the previous number n possitions ago.

eg:

n=2
1, 3, 6 (2 numbers ago), 7, 4 <-- current number
the game will ask if you have seen the current number(4) n(2) possitions ago
seen (y/n): n

n=2
1 (2 numbers ago), 5, 2, 1 <-- current number
seen (y/n): y

1. Enter the value of n.
2. You will be asked if you want to include letters and symbols, it makes the game a little harder :).
3. Each time you will see a random number on the screen and you have to enter if you have seen it n possitions ago.
